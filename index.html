  I </span>am Danyang Huang from Shanghai, China. My major is business analytics and information system, and I have studied in Iowa city for three years. We are three in my family. My father worked in Philips, and my mother started her own business last year. I come back home every summer vacation. The Moon Festival (a festival same as Thanksgiving in America) is coming, and I am not able to go back home for a family reunion. Miss them so much. <br><br>
